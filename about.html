            <p>"From time to time the Fraternity, or Greek, system is called upon to set forth the principles for which it stands.
                So far, it has been able to offer a satisfactory explanation for its existence. As a part of this system - as a
                Fraternity of Engineers - we insist that whatever our own superficial peculiarities, we exist for a purpose.</p>

            <p>We stand steadfast and firm in our belief that we serve as a necessary adjunct to our Colleges and Universities
                in the training of young engineers. Our Constitution states, without equivocation, that

                <span class="colDarkRed">the Object of the Sigma Phi Delta Fraternity shall be to promote the advancement of the Engineering Profession;
                to foster the advancement of Engineering Education;to instill a greater spirit of cooperation among Engineering
                Students and Organizations; to inculcate in its members the highest ideals of virtuous manhood, good Citizenship,
                obedience to Law, and Brotherhood; and to encourage excellence in scholarship.</span>

                These objects we endeavor to fulfill in our Laws, in our Ritual, in our conduct and in our relations with others.</p>

            <p>The Sigma Phi Delta Fraternity has, since its founding on April 11, 1924, at the University of Southern
                California, been a Professional-Social Fraternity of Engineers. We are Professional in that, unlike the General
                Fraternity, we admit to membership only students enrolled or working in a curriculum, or program, leading toward
                a degree in engineering; that we encourage and expect our Chapters to conduct and to participate in a continuing
                professional program through symposia, seminars, field trips, and similar programs; and that we encourage our
                members to give the fullest support to the faculty of the Colleges and Schools of Engineering throughout North America.</p>

            <p>We are Social in that, similar to the General Fraternity, our members maintain and live in Chapter houses; have
                a social program; participate in athletic programs; and foster a close relationship with our graduated, or
                alumni, members...</p>

            <p>...We believe in the message of Brotherly Love as the emotionality power in the lives of men. We believe in true
                Fraternity, exemplified by genuine fellowship and perpetual friendship. Further, we believe that the thoroughness
                with which our members live up to their principles governs, to a great extent, the soundness and success of this Fraternity."</p>

            <div class="colRed amaranth fontSize28">The Code of Ethics of the Sigma Phi Delta Fraternity</div>

            <p>"The Code of Ethics of Sigma Phi Delta is founded upon the basic principles of truth and honesty. The quotation
                'Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest' should be the light guiding the footsteps of Engineering
                toward service and success.</p>

            <p>An Engineer should at all times be mentally, physically, and morally clean, and should conduct himself as a
                gentleman. He should be courageous in following his own convictions, mentally awake to make use of every
                opportunity, and should consider the welfare of others before his own.</p>

            <p>To his superiors, an Engineer should be dutiful; to his co-workers, helpful; to his subordinates, generous; to all men, brotherly.</p>

            <p>An Engineer should take a good grip on the joys of life. He should play the game like a man. He should fight
                against nothing so hard as his own weaknesses, and should endeavor to gain in strength.</p>

            <p>He should live life so that his actions shall never besmirch his own honor, and thus maintain the honor of the Engineering Profession."</p>
